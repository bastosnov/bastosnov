I'm Anders, a passionate dude who loves keeping teams agile and focused around a common goal. When I'm not faciltiating valuable sessions, you'll find me deep in a rabbithole or on the dance floor, perfecting my smooth salsa moves.

Reach out if you want to collaborate on something or simply discuss why emacs *truly is* better than vim! ðŸ’»

Feel free to check out my projects and let's connect! ðŸš€âœ¨
